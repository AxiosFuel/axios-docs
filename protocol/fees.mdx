## For Borrowers: Pay What You Negotiate

Interest is negotiated between you and the lender. Axios doesn't set rates - the market does.

**Protocol Fee:** 10% of the interest (5% during beta)

**Example:**
- You borrow: 10,000 USDC
- You repay: 11,000 USDC
- Interest paid: 1,000 USDC
- Axios takes: 100 USDC (10% of the 1,000 interest)
- Lender receives: 10,900 USDC
- Your total cost: 1,100 USDC

**The fee only applies to interest, never to the principal you borrowed.**

## For Lenders: Earn What You Negotiate (Minus Small Fee)

**Protocol Fee:** 10% of your interest earnings (5% during beta)

**Example:**
- You lend: 10,000 USDC
- Borrower repays: 11,000 USDC
- Your gross earnings: 1,000 USDC interest
- Axios takes: 100 USDC (10% of interest)
- You receive: 10,900 USDC
- Your net profit: 900 USDC

**This is far lower than most platforms' spread between lending and borrowing rates.**
