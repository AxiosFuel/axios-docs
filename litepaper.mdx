# Executive Summary

Axios Finance is a **peer-to-peer lending protocol** built on the Fuel Network that enables users to borrow and lend cryptocurrency with **fixed interest rates** and **custom terms**. Unlike traditional DeFi lending pools where rates fluctuate based on utilization, Axios matches borrowers directly with lenders, ensuring both parties know their exact returns or costs upfront.

## The Problem: Unpredictable DeFi Lending

Current crypto lending platforms like Aave and Compound operate on a **shared pool model**:

- Interest rates change constantly based on supply and demand
- A lender earning 5% APY today might earn 2% tomorrow
- Borrowers face the same uncertainty with loan costs
- **Planning is impossible when rates are unpredictable**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Variable rates create uncertainty. You can't plan your finances when your costs or returns change daily.

## The Solution: Fixed-Rate Peer-to-Peer Lending

Axios introduces a fundamentally different approach:

| Feature | Axios (Fixed P2P) | Pool-Based (Aave/Compound) |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Rate Stability** | ✅ Locked at creation | ❌ Changes constantly |
| **Custom Terms** | ✅ Full control | ❌ Standardized |
| **Counterparty** | One matched user | Shared pool |
| **Risk Isolation** | ✅ Independent loans | ❌ Pool-wide exposure |
| **Predictability** | ✅ Known outcomes | ❌ Variable returns |

## How Axios Works

### Platform Overview

Axios provides a clean, intuitive interface for accessing multiple lending markets:

**Key Platform Metrics:**
- **Asset Markets**: Multiple supported assets (ETH, FUEL, USDC)
- **Loan Duration**: Flexible 1-30 day terms
- **Competitive APYs**: Market-driven rates (17-25% average)

### Creating a Loan

The borrowing interface provides complete control over loan parameters:

**Borrowers Specify:**
- **Asset to borrow** (FUEL, ETH, USDC)
- **Collateral asset and amount**
- **Loan duration** (Day, Week, or Month)
- **Expected APY** (market average or custom)

**Safety Features:**
- **LTV Ratio indicator** with Safe Zone guidance
- **Liquidation Threshold** clearly displayed (75%)
- **Health Factor monitoring** in real-time
- **Liquidation Price** calculated automatically

### Managing Positions

The dashboard provides complete visibility into all active loans:

<img src="/assets/dashboard.png" alt="User Dashboard" />

**Dashboard Features:**
- Active loan count and total borrowed/lent
- Average health factor across positions
- Time-sensitive alerts for expiring loans
- One-click repayment actions
- Position details with collateral breakdown

> [!WARNING]
> Loans expiring within 24 hours trigger automated alerts. Repay before the deadline to avoid liquidation.

### Community & Leaderboard

**Tracked Metrics:**
- Total volume per user
- Number of completed loans
- Success rate percentage
- Interest earned

## Core Mechanisms

### Collateralization

All loans are **over-collateralized** to protect lenders:

- **Conservative**: 150% (borrow $10k with $15k collateral)
- **Moderate**: 130% (borrow $10k with $13k collateral)
- **Risky**: 120% (borrow $10k with $12k collateral)

Higher collateral = safer for lenders = potentially lower interest rates.

### Liquidation

Liquidation protects lenders when loans become unsafe:

**Trigger Conditions:**
1. **Missed Repayment**: 12-24 hour grace period after expiry
2. **Collateral Value Drop**: Below safety threshold (if enabled)

**Liquidation Distribution:**
| Recipient | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Lender | Principal + 2% bonus |
| Liquidator | 0.7% of collateral |
| Protocol | 0.3% of collateral |
| Borrower | Remaining balance |

### Oracle Integration

Axios uses **Stork oracles** for real-time price data:

- Continuous price updates
- Multiple data sources aggregated
- Fair liquidation price determination

## Fee Structure

### Protocol Fee: 10% of Interest (5% During Beta)

**Example Transaction:**
- **Borrower requests**: 10,000 USDC
- **Repayment amount**: 11,000 USDC
- **Interest generated**: 1,000 USDC

**Distribution:**
- **Lender receives**: 10,900 USDC
- **Protocol fee**: 100 USDC (10% of interest)
- **Borrower total cost**: 11,000 USDC

> [!NOTE]
> Fees are calculated on interest only, never on principal. This is significantly lower than the spread on traditional lending platforms.

## Use Cases

### Scenario 1: The Crypto Holder

**Sarah's Situation:**
- Owns 10 ETH worth $35,000
- Needs $20,000 for a business opportunity
- Believes ETH price will rise

**Axios Solution:**
1. Borrows 20,000 USDC for 90 days
2. Deposits 8 ETH ($28,000) as collateral
3. Agrees to repay 21,000 USDC (5% interest)
4. Uses funds for business
5. Repays and retrieves ETH

**Result:** Maintained ETH exposure + accessed capital for only $1,000 in interest.

### Scenario 2: The Yield Seeker

**Michael's Situation:**
- Has 50,000 USDC sitting idle
- Wants predictable returns
- Uncomfortable with variable rates

**Axios Solution:**
1. Creates loan offer: 50,000 USDC for 30 days
2. Requires 150% collateral ratio
3. Demands 50,500 USDC repayment (12% APY)
4. Receives repayment after 30 days
5. Earns 450 USDC net profit (after 50 USDC fee)

**Result:** Earned 10.8% APY net with strong collateral protection.
