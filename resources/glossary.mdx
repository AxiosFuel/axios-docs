| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **APY (Annual Percentage Yield)** | The yearly return on an investment, accounting for compounding. A 10% APY means you earn 10% per year. |
| **Blockchain** | A network of computers that maintains a shared, tamper-proof record of transactions. Think of it as a public ledger that no single person controls. |
| **Collateral** | Assets you put up as security for a loan. If you don't repay, the lender gets your collateral. |
| **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)** | Financial services built on blockchains without traditional intermediaries like banks. |
| **Gas Fee** | The cost to execute transactions on a blockchain. These fees pay for computing power and network security. |
| **Liquidation** | The automatic sale of collateral when a loan becomes unsafe. Protects lenders from losses. |
| **Liquidity** | How easily an asset can be converted to cash. High liquidity = easy to buy/sell. Low liquidity = hard to trade. |
| **Oracle** | A service that provides external data (like prices) to smart contracts on the blockchain. |
| **Over-collateralized** | Putting up more collateral value than you're borrowing. E.g., borrowing $10k with $15k collateral. |
| **P2P** | Direct transactions between two people without a middleman. Axios matches borrowers directly with lenders. |
| **Smart Contract** | Self-executing code on a blockchain. Like a vending machine - it follows rules automatically without human intervention. |
| **Stablecoin** | Cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value (usually $1). Examples: USDC, USDT, DAI. |
