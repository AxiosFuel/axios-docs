# What Is Axios Finance?

Axios Finance is a lending platform where you can borrow or lend cryptocurrency directly with other people. Think of it like Craigslist for crypto loans - you post what you want, negotiate terms with another person, and the code automatically enforces your agreement.

## Three Key Differences

1. **Fixed Rates**: You lock in your interest rate upfront. It won't change, no matter what happens in the market.
2. **Direct Matching**: You're matched with one other person, not lending to a shared pool of money.
3. **Custom Terms**: You choose your own loan duration, interest rate, and collateral amount.

## Why Does This Matter?

### The Problem with Current Crypto Lending

Most crypto lending platforms (like Aave or Compound) work like this:
- Everyone deposits money into one big shared pool
- Interest rates change constantly based on supply and demand
- You might start earning 5% APY, but wake up tomorrow earning 2%
- This unpredictability makes planning impossible

### How Axios Solves This

Imagine you're lending $10,000 and want to earn exactly 10% over 90 days. On Axios:
1. You post your offer: "I'll lend $10,000 USDC for 90 days, you pay me back $10,250"
2. A borrower accepts your terms
3. The interest rate is locked - you'll earn exactly $250, guaranteed
4. After 90 days, you get your money back plus interest

**No surprises. No rate changes. Just predictable returns.**
