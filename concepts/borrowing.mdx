<img src="/assets/borrow.png" alt="Borrow Interface" />

### Step 1: Select Your Loan Terms

1. **Choose what to borrow**: Select the asset and amount (e.g., 1,000 USDC)
2. **Set your collateral**: Choose the asset you'll deposit as security (e.g., ETH)
3. **Pick loan duration**: 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month
4. **Set interest rate**: Enter your offered APY or use the market average

→ *The interface will calculate your repayment total and required collateral automatically*

### Step 2: Review Your Position

Check the following metrics:
- **LTV Ratio**: Should be in the "Safe Zone" (ideally 130-150%)
- **Liquidation Threshold**: The price at which your collateral gets liquidated
- **Health Factor**: Must stay above 1.00

→ *These values update in real-time as you adjust amounts*

### Step 3: Confirm Your Request

<Warning>
Your collateral can be liquidated if its value drops significantly. [Learn more about liquidation risk](collateral-and-liquidation)
</Warning>

1. Click **Create Borrow Request**
2. Approve the transaction in your wallet

→ *Your request will appear in the Markets tab as "Pending"*

### Step 4: Wait for a Lender Match

Your request stays open until:
- A lender accepts your terms, OR
- You cancel the request, OR
- The expiration time is reached

→ *You'll receive a notification when a lender fills your request*

### Step 5: Receive Your Funds

Once matched:
- The borrowed amount arrives in your wallet immediately
- Your collateral is locked in the smart contract
- A countdown timer shows your repayment deadline

### Step 6: Repay Before Deadline

1. Go to your **Dashboard**
2. Find your active loan
3. Click **Repay Loan**
4. Confirm the transaction

→ *Your collateral is released automatically after repayment confirmation*

## What Happens If You're Late?

- **Grace period**: 12-24 hours after the deadline
- **After grace period**: Anyone can liquidate your position
- **Liquidation**: Your collateral is sold to repay the lender + penalty fees

<Tip>
Set calendar reminders 24-48 hours before your repayment deadline. You can repay early at any time.
