## For Borrowers

**Step 1: Create a Loan Request**

You specify:
- **What you want to borrow**: e.g., 1,000 USDC
- **What you'll pay back**: e.g., 1,100 USDC (10% interest)
- **When you'll pay it back**: e.g., 30 days
- **What you'll put up as security**: e.g., $1,500 worth of ETH

**Step 2: Wait for a Lender**
A lender sees your request and decides if your terms are fair. If yes, they accept and send you the 1,000 USDC.

**Step 3: Use Your Money**
The 1,000 USDC goes to your wallet. Your ETH is held securely by the smart contract (automated code) as collateral.

**Step 4: Pay It Back**
Before 30 days are up, you pay back 1,100 USDC.

**Step 5: Get Your Collateral Back**
The smart contract automatically returns your ETH to you. Done!
