## For Lenders

**Step 1: Create a Loan Offer**

You post:
- **What you're lending**: 1,000 USDC
- **What you want back**: 1,100 USDC
- **Duration**: 30 days
- **Required collateral**: $1,500 worth of ETH

**Step 2: Wait for a Borrower**
A borrower sees your offer and accepts your terms. They put up their ETH, and your USDC is sent to them.

**Step 3: Earn Fixed Returns**
You wait 30 days. No work required.

**Step 4: Get Repaid**
After 30 days, you receive 1,100 USDC automatically. You earned $100 (10% over 30 days = 120% APY).

**Step 5: Sleep Well**
If the borrower doesn't pay back, their ETH collateral is liquidated (sold automatically) and you still get your money back plus a bonus.
